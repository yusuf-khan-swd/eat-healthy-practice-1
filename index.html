        <p>
          Its no secret that the amount of calories people eat and drink has a
          direct impact on their weight: Consume the same number of calories
          that the body burns over time, and weight stays stable. Consume more
          than the body burns, weight goes up. Less, weight goes down. But what
          about the type of calories: Does it matter whether they come from
          specific nutrients-fat, protein, or carbohydrate? Specific foods-whole
          grains or potato chips? Specific diets-the Mediterranean diet or the
          “Twinkie” diet? And what about when or where people consume their
          calories: Does eating breakfast make it easier to control weight? Does
          eating at fast-food restaurants make it harder?

        Place eggs in a saucepan or pot and cover with cold water. Eggs first,
        then water. Why? Because if you put the eggs in afterward, they might
        crack as they fall to the bottom of the pan. It's no fun to learn this
        the hard way.

          How to Hard Cook Eggs in the Oven This method is just a bit
          unorthodox. It requires zero water - which, technically makes this
          method more hard-baking than hard-boiling. But stay with us here.
          Oven-baked "hard-boiled" eggs are just eggs heated up in a hot, dry
          oven. It's a smart move when you're making loads of eggs or stovetop
          space is at a premium.
